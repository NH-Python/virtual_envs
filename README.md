# Virtual Environments Lightning Talks

Links and materials presented for the [NH Python meetup](https://www.meetup.com/New-Hampshire-Python-Group/events/qxqqtrydcgblc/) given April 2022.

>In celebration of Earth Day, this month’s meetup is all about the environment...or more specifically, virtual environments! The evening will kick off by covering what they are and why you’d want to use them. Following that will be a series of lightning talks to introduce Python's venv module, Anaconda, Poetry, and virtualenvwrapper.
>
>We won’t pick up any trash together, but this discussion should help you clean up and keep your Python environments nice and tidy!

This repository contains a copy of the slideshow that covered the introduction, the `venv` module, and Anaconda. Original materials can be found in the following links:
